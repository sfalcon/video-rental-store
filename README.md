# video-rental-store

Hybrid project of clojure/java. The alternative approach is to do this with maven

## Usage

Leiningen needs to be installed (http://leiningen.org/)

Once installed, one can run tests with `lein midje test' and run the server with `lein run'

There are no scripts to test against the server (yet).
The REST API exposes endpoints to manage film and customer resources and operations to rent.

Postman (http://www.getpostman.com/) for chrome is a great tool for exploring APIs.
